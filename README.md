"A person's name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language." - Dale Carnegie

"Always use the proper name for things, Harry. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself." - Albus Dumbledore

Want to advance your career--or just brighten someone's day? Greeting a person by name isn't just polite. It's a powerful way to solidify relationships. 

This app will help people quickly learn the names of a specific group of people. Potential uses are:
- Learning the names of students in a class
- Learning the names of coworkers at a new office
- Learning the names of other people in a Tech Bootcamp
- Etc.

The app will allow users to upload a set of names, photos, descriptions, and pronunciations. Then, they will be able to quiz themselves with a custom set of flashcards. They can also view an entire collection of names to quickly refresh their memory at any time.

Basic features:
- Upload multiple collections of names, photos, descriptions, and pronunciations.
- Quiz by presenting a photo and requiring the user to type in the correct name.
- Review all names and photos in a collection at once for a quick refresher.
- Use on either web or mobile due to responsive design.

Advanced features may include:
- Provide a hint when you get a name wrong (such as description.)
- Test yourself just on the cards you get wrong after going through the full set.
- Test yourself on description rather than photo recognition.
- Multiple choice questions.
- Pull names of friends from Facebook groups, LinkedIn or Yale Facebook.
